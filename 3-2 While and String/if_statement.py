# __name__ is a variable that is declared even if you have a blank python file
# it generally tells us the name of the file that the code is from.
# if its the file that you run python3 on, it gets called __main__ regardless of the actual name
# def main(): <-- this is nothing
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # your code here
    print('hello', __name__)
    # put all your code in here... just go with it...
